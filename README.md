# Sketch-Generator
Developed a customized program utilizing OpenCV and Python to interact with the user's camera. Implemented functionality to capture the user's image with a programmable delay, perform real-time black and white image conversion and then convert it to sketch, and subsequently save the image as a high-quality JPEG file on the user's local system.
